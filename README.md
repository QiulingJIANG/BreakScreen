# BreakScreen

A fullscreen break reminder that forces you to rest — because you won't do it yourself.

## Features

- Fullscreen break reminder that jumps in your face — even if you're in another app (Esc to escape, but I'll judge you)
- Auto mode: Work ends → fullscreen break starts automatically → break ends → next round begins. (Zero clicks needed.)
- Manual mode: Work ends → click "Start Break" when ready → break ends → click "Start Working" for next round. (You're the boss.)
